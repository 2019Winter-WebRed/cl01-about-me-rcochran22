        <hr/>
        <p>My name is Riley Cochran. I was born on April 19, 2004. My parents are Amanda and Brian Cochran. I have 3 sisters Kayla,25, Emily,13, and Abbey,12. I have a chaocolate lab toby. One of the qoutes I try to live by is</p> <blockquote>"fear ends where faith begins"</blockquote> <p>I am a cheerleader and some seasons I play volleyball. I hvae cheered for M.O.T , Tristate and now I cheer for CFA. I enjoy cheer and I practice alot at home and at practice. I make sure to stretch daily so I can become for flexiable to do harder tumbling passes.</p>
        <p>I also love to edit and film little videos/movies with my best friend Kate. We film together and I go back home so excited to edit the video. I hope to keep my skills and gain more. I am working towards going into video, directing or editing. Im always saving for more cameras and sd cards. It takes me hours to perfect the video. Then when im done I will show my best friend and we would laugh at our self.One of my favorite movies is <i>8th grade</i></p>
        <p>I also like to bake a lot. When I bake Im baking I have so much friends. I will alwasy try to go out of my way to make the cake or, whatever it is that im making better. I love rolling out fondant and pipig cakes. The best part of baking is getting to eat the finished product after with my friends and family. I love to bake with my friends I find it so much fun and we make so many memories doing so.</p>
